Contains all the tools to extract information from the PDFs published by the Election Commission of India.

Election Commission of India publishes all the information regarding voter rolls and polling booths in their respective state websites.  The main website is http://eci.nic.in/eci/eci.html and the respective state websites can be navigated from there.  Please remember, each state has its own way of publishing the information, and we may have to spend some time to investigate the intricacies and then create tools accordingly.  Another issue is that some states publish the information in that state's language creating more complexities.  

The tools published so far work for the following states
